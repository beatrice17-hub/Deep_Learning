# Deep_Learning
Deep learning project for image classification project in Google Collab
1. Beatrice_MNIST_fashion_CNN.ipynb : an example of CNN using MNIST fashion dataset
2. MultiClass_Classification-VGG16.ipynb : an example of VGG16 application for multiclass classification (among ocean, forest, highway). The dataset for training and validation store in the 3scenes.zip file (can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aqb5QLEM0OGgvAAzUHHLLU6zQJwuxpdd/view?usp=sharing) and the test dataset stored in test.zip 
3. test_classify_image.py and train_classify_image.py : an example of how to separate test and train code (but still in the same directory) to classify image based on this dataset here (including ocean, forest, highway, room): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SM5fbEmCl9IjDWUPzjHjPE9rYrLc2oqp?usp=sharing and the test dataset stored in test.zip (same as above)
